# 0. How to download the game

## a. Option 1: Without source code.

Download the game (compressed into a .zip file) at the following
link: https://github.com/nmhienbn/PVZ-Kaito-NMH-Edition/releases/tag/published<br/>
This method saves a lot of memory and download time (around 103MB).<br/>
Extract the game into a folder and run pvz.exe to play.<br/>

## b. Option 2: With source code and can be compiled.

**Step 1:** Clone this repo (About 800 MB - includes version history). <br/>
Or select Code -> Download Zip (About 90MB)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65478890/236433509-2d4e5f97-ddc4-4daa-ae8f-9119c31b8d29.png)

**All the code is in the src folder.<br/>
**You can skip to step 5 to start playing.

**Step 2:** Install MinGW. Here, I install the MinGW-W64
GCC-8.1.0 [x86_64-posix-seh](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download)
version.<br/>
Some notes: <br/>

- If you use another compiler, you need to recompile the icon: go to the icon folder and use the
  command `windres main.rc -O coff main.res` in cmd.<br/>
- You need to delete three c++ dll files in the folder containing
  pvz.exe: `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libstdc++-6.dll`, `libwinpthread-1.dll`. These dll files are only for players who
  don't have c++ installed on their computer.

**Step 3:** Install GNU make.

**Step 4:** Open cmd in the folder containing the Makefile and type the command "make".

**Step 5:** Run pvz.exe and start playing.

# 1. Starting the game

Wait a few seconds and then click on the "CLICK TO START!" button to start playing the game.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![ezgif com-video-to-gif](resources/preview/loading.gif)

</div>

When entering the game for the first time, players should enter their name to start the game. Then click "OK" or press
Enter to continue.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/name.png)

</div>

Players will immediately receive their first plant - the Peashooter.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/first_plant.png)

</div>

# 2. Choosing a level

There are a total of 12 levels with varying levels of difficulty for players to choose from. When hovering over a level,
that level will light up. Simply click the mouse to play that level.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/choose_level.png)

</div>

However, when starting out, you can only unlock 1 level. Win each level in order to unlock and play the next level:

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/choose_level1.png)

</div>

In addition, there are 3 other function buttons for players to change their name, close the game, or even reset the game
progress to experience the game again from the beginning:

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/choose_level2.png)

</div>

When entering the game, there are 2 types of levels that players will encounter: morning (left side) and night (right
side).

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/levels.png)

</div>

- In the morning, there will occasionally be sun (sun) falling from the sky.
- In the night, there is none, so the game will be slightly harder.

Before starting the game, you will know what types of zombies will appear.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

</div>

# 3. Components of the game:

- Sun

![image](resources/preview/sun.png)

: a unit to buy plants in the game. Click to collect. And note that if a sun exists for too long, it will gradually fade
and disappear. You won't be able to collect them after they disappear.

- Sun bar

![image](resources/preview/sun_bar.png)

: a scoreboard of the number of suns that the player currently has.

- Plant seeds: all types of plants that the player owns. To select a plant to plant, the player must click on the plant
  seed or press keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (as marked in the game) to select the plant and then plant it on the field. Of
  course, you must have enough sun to buy the plant, and the plant seed must have a different waiting time to plant that
  type of plant again.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/plant_seed.png)

</div>

- Shovel: an extremely effective tool for you to dig up unnecessary plants and replace them with new ones.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/shovel.png)

</div>

- Game progress bar: a bar that you can follow to see how many zombies are left to come or how many parts of the level
  you have played. On the left is the current level you are playing.

<div style="text-align: center; ">

![image](resources/preview/progress_bar.png)

</div>

- Turbo button: If you find the game too slow or too easy and you need to save time, press the button to experience the
  game at twice the original speed.
- And if you find the game too scary at this speed, just press it again to return to normal speed.
  ● Game at the original speed:

![image](resources/preview/faster.png)

● Game currently at twice the original speed:

![image](resources/preview/faster_triggered.png)

- Pause Button: Do you need to pause the game to play later? Or do you want to adjust the volume of the background music
  and sound effects? Too simple, the game can be paused by clicking

![image](resources/preview/pause.png)

or clicking outside the game.

- Mower: If you leave zombies too close to your house, the mower will automatically activate and destroy all zombies
  currently in that row. Note that there is only one mower per row.

# 4. How to play

Plant plants to attack and defend, and prevent zombies from entering your house.<br/>
To plant a plant, select the seed of that plant (using the keyboard or mouse) and place it in the desired square. <br/>

Plants will be eaten by zombies.
